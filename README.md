The accompanying Jupyter notebook contains Python 3 solutions for several problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). If you look at my Project Euler [profile](https://projecteuler.net/progress=ewatkeys), you'll notice this is a small subset of the total problems I've solved. This is simply here to demonstrate that I can indeed write Python when called upon.

I wrote the answers to questions one through seven in a single four hour-ish period after not having written Python seriously since 2010 or so. At that time I was still using Python 2.x, as Django at that time hadn't yet been ported to Python 3. I think. I'm basing this on my foggy nine-year old recollections.

It's also worth noting that these answers are _not_ translations of my original answers to these questions, which I wrote in Clojure. For these answers, I didn't even _look_ at my Clojure answers, as Python doesn't particularly aspire to being a functional programming language, and porting almost-entirely functional Cloure code is more difficult — and more likely to result in uglier code — than simply considering the problem afresh and writing an idiomatic Python solution. 

If you're reading this _and actually trying to solve Project Euler problems_ then you should stop reading now, because there's no point (and no joy) in solving the problems if you don't sweat over them yourself.
